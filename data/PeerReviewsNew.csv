What is required to combine human biomonitoring and health surveys?,"Hanna Tolonen, Sonja Moore, Dominik Lermen, Ana Virgolino, Lisbeth E Knudsen, Anna-Maria Andersson, Loïc Rambaud, Carla Ancona, Marike Kolossa-Gehring ",2022-03,HBM4EU; Health; Human biomonitoring; Survey; Population; Biological samples; Questionnaire; Measurement,"Obtaining holistic information about health and health determinants at the population level should also include data on environmental risk factors of health. So far, only a few countries have combined, at the national level, health and human biomonitoring (HBM) surveys to collect extensive information on health, lifestyles, biological health determinants and environmental exposures. This paper will provide guidelines on how to combine health and HBM surveys and what is the added value of doing so. Health and HBM surveys utilize similar infrastructure and data collection methods including questionnaires, collection and analysis of biological samples, and objective health measurements. There are many overlapping or comparable steps in these two survey types. At the European level, detailed protocols for conducting a health examination survey or HBM study exists separately but there is no protocol for a combined survey available by now. Our recommendations for combined health and HBM surveys focus on a cross-sectional survey on general population aged 6–79 years. To avoid unnecessary participant burden, for the selection of included measurements basic principle would be to ensure that results of the measurements have a public health relevance and clear interpretation. Combining health and HBM surveys into one survey would produce an extensive database for research to support policy decisions in many fields such as public health and chemical regulations. Combined surveys are cost-effective as only one infrastructure is needed to collect information and recruit participants.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463922000475?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2022.113964

In this study, performed under the HBM4EU project, we focused on better understanding the determinants of exposure and recognising how risk management measures (RMMs) contribute to a reduction in exposure. HBM and occupational hygiene data were collected from 399 workers and 203 controls recruited in nine European countries. Urinary total chromium (U-Cr), personal inhalable and respirable dust of Cr and Cr(VI) and Cr from hand wipes were collected. Data on the RMMs were collected by questionnaires. We studied the association between different exposure parameters and the use of RMMs. The relationship between exposure by inhalation and U-Cr in different worker groups was analysed using regression analysis and found a strong association. Automatisation of Cr electroplating dipping explained lower exposure levels in platers. The use of personal protective equipment resulted in lower U-Cr levels in welding, bath plating and painting. An effect of wearing gloves was observed in machining. An effect of local exhaust ventilation and training was observed in welding. Regression analyses showed that in platers, exposure to air level of 5 µg/m3 corresponds to U-Cr level of 7 µg/g creatinine. In welders, the same inhalation exposure resulted in lower U-Cr levels reflecting toxicokinetic differences of different chromium species.",,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3683,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063683

Besides traditional risk factors such as smoking, some environmental substances can augment the risk of COPD. The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a program evaluating citizens’ exposure to various environmental substances and their possible health impacts. Within the HBM4EU, eighteen priority substances or substance groups were chosen. In this scoping review, seven of these substances or substance groups are reported to have an association or a possible association with COPD. Main exposure routes, vulnerable and high-exposure risk groups, and matrices where these substances are measured are described. Pesticides in general and especially organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, and some herbicides, lead (Pb), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed an association, and cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr and CrVI), arsenic (As), and diisocyanates, a possible association with COPD and/or decreased lung function. Due to long latency in COPD’s disease process, the role of chemical exposure as a risk factor for COPD is probably underestimated. More research is needed to support evidence-based conclusions. Generally, chemical exposure is a growing issue of concern, and prompt action is needed to safeguard public health. ",,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/7/3945,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19073945

This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward.

Using Human Biomonitoring Data to Support Risk Assessment of Cosmetic Ingredients—A Case Study of Benzophenone-3,"Christophe Rousselle, Matthieu Meslin, Tamar Berman, Marjolijn Woutersen, Wieneke Bil, Jenna Wildeman, Qasim Chaudhry ",2022-02,human biomonitoring; UV filters; benzophenone-3; HBM4EU; risk assessment; RCR; margin of safety,"Safety assessment of UV filters for human health by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) is based on the estimation of internal dose following external (skin) application of cosmetic products, and comparison with a toxicological reference value after conversion to internal dose. Data from human biomonitoring (HBM) could be very useful in this regard, because it is based on the measurement of real-life internal exposure of the human population to a chemical. UV filters were included in the priority list of compounds to be addressed under the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), and risk assessment of benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was carried out based on HBM data. Using BP-3 as an example, this study investigated the benefits and limitations of the use of external versus internal exposure data to explore the usefulness of HBM to support the risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients. The results show that both approaches did indicate a risk to human health under certain levels of exposure. They also highlight the need for more robust exposure data on BP-3 and other cosmetic ingredients, and a standardized framework for incorporating HBM data in the risk assessment of cosmetic products.",,https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/10/2/96,

Flame retardants (FRs) are of particular concern due to their wide distribution in the environment and adverse health effects. This article reviews studies published in 2009–2020 on the chemical analysis of FRs in a variety of human samples and discusses the characteristics of the analytical methods applied to different FR biomarkers of exposure, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), novel halogenated flame retardants (NHFRs), bromophenols, incl. tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and organophosphorous flame retardants (PFRs). Among the extraction techniques, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) were used most frequently due to the good efficiencies in the isolation of the majority of the FR biomarkers, but with challenges for highly lipophilic FRs. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is mainly applied in the instrumental analysis of PBDEs and most NHFRs, with recent inclusions of GC-MS/MS and high resolution MS techniques. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS is mainly applied to HBCD, bromophenols, incl. TBBPA, and PFRs (including metabolites), however, GC-based analysis following derivatization has also been used for phenolic compounds and PFR metabolites. Developments are noticed towards more universal analytical methods, which enable widening method scopes in the human biomonitoring of FRs. Challenges exist with regard to sensitivity required for the low concentrations of FRs in the general population and limited sample material for some human matrices. A strong focus on quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) measures is required in the analysis of FR biomarkers in human samples, related to their variety of physical-chemical properties, low levels in most human samples and the risk of contamination.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267021006541?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2021.338828

Thus, exposure surveillance is an important requirement for health risk management and prevention of occupational disease. Human biomonitoring by measurement of specific biomarkers in body fluids is considered as an effective method of exposure surveillance. The aim of this study is to investigate the internal exposure of workers processing e-waste using a human biomonitoring approach, which will stimulate improved work practices and contribute to raising awareness of potential hazards. This exploratory study in occupational exposures in e-waste processing is part of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Here we present a study protocol using a cross sectional survey design to study worker’s exposures and compare these to the exposure of subjects preferably employed in the same company but with no known exposure to industrial recycling of e-waste. The present study protocol will be applied in six to eight European countries to ensure standardised data collection. The target population size is 300 exposed and 150 controls. Biomarkers of exposure for the following chemicals will be used: chromium, cadmium and lead in blood and urine; brominated flame retardants and polychlorobiphenyls in blood; mercury, organophosphate flame retardants and phthalates in urine, and chromium, cadmium, lead and mercury in hair. In addition, the following effect biomarkers will be studied: micronuclei, epigenetic, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and telomere length in blood and metabolomics in urine. Occupational hygiene sampling methods (airborne and settled dust, silicon wristbands and handwipes) and contextual information will be collected to facilitate the interpretation of the biomarker results and discuss exposure mitigating interventions to further reduce exposures if needed.

Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population.

AOP-helpFinder webserver: a tool for comprehensive analysis of the literature to support adverse outcome pathways development,"Florence Jornod, Thomas Jaylet, Ludek Blaha, Denis Sarigiannis, Luc Tamisier, Karine Audouze",2021-10,,"Abstract
Motivation
Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are a conceptual framework developed to support the use of alternative toxicology approaches in the risk assessment. AOPs are structured linear organizations of existing knowledge illustrating causal pathways from the initial molecular perturbation triggered by various stressors, through key events (KEs) at different levels of biology, to the ultimate health or ecotoxicological adverse outcome.

Results
Artificial intelligence can be used to systematically explore available toxicological data that can be parsed in the scientific literature. Recently, a tool called AOP-helpFinder was developed to identify associations between stressors and KEs supporting thus documentation of AOPs. To facilitate the utilization of this advanced bioinformatics tool by the scientific and the regulatory community, a webserver was created. The proposed AOP-helpFinder webserver uses better performing version of the tool which reduces the need for manual curation of the obtained results. As an example, the server was successfully applied to explore relationships of a set of endocrine disruptors with metabolic-related events. The AOP-helpFinder webserver assists in a rapid evaluation of existing knowledge stored in the PubMed database, a global resource of scientific information, to build AOPs and Adverse Outcome Networks supporting the chemical risk assessment.",,https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/4/1173/6414613?login=false,

The European Joint Programme HBM4EU derives such values, named human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs), for priority substances which could be of regulatory relevance for policy makers and have been identified by experts of the participating countries, ministries, agencies and stakeholders at EU and national level. NMP and NEP are such substances for which unresolved policy relevant issues should be clarified by targeted research. Since widespread exposure of the general population in Germany to NMP and NEP was shown for the age groups 3–17 years and 20–29 years, further investigations on exposure to NMP and NEP in other European countries are warranted. The HBM-GVs derived for both solvents focus on developmental toxicity as decisive endpoint. They amount for the sum of the two specific urinary NMP metabolites 5-HNMP and 2-HMSI and likewise of the two specific urinary NEP metabolites 5-HNEP and 2-HESI to 10 mg/L for children and 15 mg/L for adolescents/adults. The values were determined following a consultation process on the value proposals within HBM4EU. A health-based risk assessment was performed using the newly derived HBM-GVGenPop and exposure data from two recent studies from Germany. The risk assessment revealed that even when considering the combined exposure to both substances by applying the Hazard Index approach, the measured concentrations are below the HBM-GVGenPop in all cases investigated (i.e., children, adolescents and young adults).","HBM-GVs are a prerequisite for an easy to use health-based risk assessment of human biomonitoring results.

Fernandez, Elizabeth Bengtsen, Ulla Vogel, Karin Sørig Hougaard, Anne Thoustrup Saber 10/2021",2021-10,Human biomonitoring; HBM4EU; Effect biomarkers; Susceptibility biomarkers; Neurodevelopmental toxicity; Epigenetics,"Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and a potent toxic compound. Humans are exposed to Pb through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact via food, water, tobacco smoke, air, dust, and soil. Pb accumulates in bones, brain, liver and kidney. Fetal exposure occurs via transplacental transmission. The most critical health effects are developmental neurotoxicity in infants and cardiovascular effects and nephrotoxicity in adults.

Pb exposure has been steadily decreasing over the past decades, but there are few recent exposure data from the general European population; moreover, no safe Pb limit has been set. Sensitive biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility, that reliably and timely indicate Pb-associated toxicity are required to assess human exposure-health relationships in a situation of low to moderate exposure.

Therefore, a systematic literature review based on PubMed entries published before July 2019 that addressed Pb exposure and biomarkers of effect and susceptibility, neurodevelopmental toxicity, epigenetic modifications, and transcriptomics was conducted. Finally included were 58 original papers on Pb exposure and 17 studies on biomarkers. The biomarkers that are linked to Pb exposure and neurodevelopment were grouped into effect biomarkers (serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serum/saliva cortisol), susceptibility markers (epigenetic markers and gene sequence variants) and other biomarkers (serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), maternal iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) status). Serum BDNF and plasma HDL are potential candidates to be further validated as effect markers for routine use in HBM studies of Pb, complemented by markers of Fe and Ca status to also address nutritional interactions related to neurodevelopmental disorders. For several markers, a causal relationship with Pb-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity is likely. Results on BDNF are discussed in relation to Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) 13 (""Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities”) of the AOP-Wiki. Further studies are needed to validate sensitive, reliable, and timely effect biomarkers, especially for low to moderate Pb exposure scenarios.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143846392100170X?via%3Dihub,

Fernánde",2021-10,Metals; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Behavior; Human biomonitoring; Effect biomarker; HBM4EU; DNA methylation,"Background
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in brain development by regulating multiple pathways within the central nervous system. In the Human Biomonitoring for Europe Project (HBM4EU), this neurotrophin is being implemented as a novel effect biomarker to evaluate the potential threats of environmental chemicals on neurodevelopment.

Objectives
To explore the relationships among exposure to environmental metals, BDNF biomarkers at two levels of biological complexity, and behavioral function in adolescent males.

Methods
Data were gathered from 125 adolescents on: spot urine sample total concentrations of the neurotoxic metal(oid)s arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb); serum BDNF protein concentrations; and concurrent behavioral functioning according to the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL/6–18). In 113 of the participants, information was also collected on blood BDNF DNA methylation at six CpGs. Associations were evaluated by multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for confounders.

Results
As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were detected in 100%, 98.5%, 97.0%, and 89.5% of urine samples, respectively. Median serum BDNF concentration was 32.6 ng/mL, and total percentage of BDNF gene methylation was 3.8%. In the adjusted models, urinary As was non-linearly associated with more internalizing problems and Cd with more externalizing behaviors. The percentage BDNF DNA methylation at CPGs #5 and the mean percentage CpG methylation increased across As tertiles (p-trend = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively), while 2nd tertile and 3rd tertile of Cd concentrations were associated with lower serum BDNF and higher CpG3 methylation percentage. Additionally, when BDNF was categorized in tertiles, serum BDNF at the 3rd tertile was associated with fewer behavioral problems, particularly withdrawn (p-trend = 0.04), social problems (p-trend = 0.12), and thought problems (p-trend = 0.04).

Conclusion
Exposure to As and Cd was associated with BDNF gene DNA methylation BDNF gene and serum BDNF, respectively. Associations with DNA methylation may be attributable to a higher variability over time in circulating BDNF concentrations than in the methylation status of this gene. Caution should be taken when interpreting the results relating postnatal Pb and Hg to behavioral functioning. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.","BDNF was evaluated as a biomarker of behavioral functioning in adolescent males.

Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been linked to altered behavior in children. Within the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network was constructed supporting the mechanistic link between BPA exposure and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

Objective
To test this toxicologically-based hypothesis in the prospective INMA-Granada birth cohort (Spain).

Methods
BPA concentrations were quantified by LC-MS/MS in spot urine samples from boys aged 9–11 years, normalized by creatinine and log-2 transformed. At adolescence (15–17 years), blood and urine specimens were collected, and serum and urinary BDNF protein levels were measured using immunoassays. DNA methylation levels at 6 CpGs in Exon IV of the BDNF gene were also assessed in peripheral blood using bisulfite-pyrosequencing. Adolescent's behavior was parent-rated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) in 148 boys. Adjusted linear regression and mediation models were fit.

Results
Childhood urinary BPA concentrations were longitudinally and positively associated with thought problems (β = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.49) and somatic complaints (β = 0.80; 95% CI: −0.16, 1.75) at adolescence. BPA concentrations were positively associated with BDNF DNA methylation at CpG6 (β = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.36) and mean CpG methylation (β = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.18), but not with total serum or urinary BDNF protein levels. When independent variables were categorized in tertiles, positive dose-response associations were observed between BPA-thought problems (p-trend = 0.08), BPA-CpG6 (p-trend ≤ 0.01), and CpG6-thought problems (p-trend ≤ 0.01). A significant mediated effect by CpG6 DNA methylation was observed (β = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.57), accounting for up to 34% of the BPA-thought problems association.

Conclusions
In line with toxicological studies, BPA exposure was longitudinally associated with increased BDNF DNA methylation, supporting the biological plausibility of BPA-behavior relationships previously described in the epidemiological literature. Given its novelty and preliminary nature, this effect biomarker approach should be replicated in larger birth cohorts.","Childhood BPA exposure was linked to higher BDNF DNA methylation at adolescence.

We applied a cross-sectional study design and used chromium in urine as the primary biomonitoring method for Cr(VI) exposure. Additionally, we studied the use of red blood cells (RBC) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for biomonitoring of exposure to Cr(VI). Personal measurements were used to study exposure to inhalable and respirable Cr(VI) by personal air sampling. Dermal exposure was studied by taking hand wipe samples.

The highest internal exposures were observed in the use of Cr(VI) in electrolytic bath plating. In stainless steel welding the internal Cr exposure was clearly lower when compared to plating activities. We observed a high correlation between chromium urinary levels and air Cr(VI) or dermal total Cr exposure. Urinary chromium showed its value as a first approach for the assessment of total, internal exposure. Correlations between urinary chromium and Cr(VI) in EBC and Cr in RBC were low, probably due to differences in kinetics and indicating that these biomonitoring approaches may not be interchangeable but rather complementary.

This study showed that occupational biomonitoring studies can be conducted successfully by multi-national collaboration and provide relevant information to support policy actions aiming to reduce occupational exposure to chemicals.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121012792,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111984

For this purpose, a network of laboratories delivering reliable analytical data on human exposure is fundamental. The analytical comparability and accuracy of laboratories analysing flame retardants (FRs) in serum and urine were investigated by a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) scheme comprising interlaboratory comparison investigations (ICIs) and external quality assurance schemes (EQUASs).

This paper presents the evaluation process and discusses the results of four ICI/EQUAS rounds performed from 2018 to 2020 for the determination of ten halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) represented by three congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, BDE-153 and BDE-209), two isomers of hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCD and γ-HBCD), two dechloranes (anti-DP and syn-DP), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) in serum, and four metabolites of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) in urine, at two concentration levels. The number of satisfactory results reported by laboratories increased during the four rounds. In the case of HFRs, the scope of the participating laboratories varied substantially (from two to ten) and in most cases did not cover the entire target spectrum of chemicals. The highest participation rate was reached for BDE-47 and BDE-153. The majority of participants achieved more than 70% satisfactory results for these two compounds over all rounds. For other HFRs, the percentage of successful laboratories varied from 44 to 100%. The evaluation of TBBPA, DBDPE, and 2,4,6-TBP was not possible because the number of participating laboratories was too small. Only seven laboratories participated in the ICI/EQUAS scheme for OPFR metabolites and five of them were successful for at least two biomarkers. Nevertheless, the evaluation of laboratory performance using Z-scores in the first three rounds required an alternative approach compared to HFRs because of the small number of participants and the high variability of experts' results. The obtained results within the ICI/EQUAS programme showed a significant core network of comparable European laboratories for HBM of BDE-47, BDE-153, BDE-209, α-HBCD, γ-HBCD, anti-DP, and syn-DP. On the other hand, the data revealed a critically low analytical capacity in Europe for HBM of TBBPA, DBDPE, and 2,4,6-TBP as well as for the OPFR biomarkers.","The HBM4EU QA/QC programme showed the state of play in FR biomonitoring in Europe.

Exposure to different types of pesticides may increase the risks of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease, but also of reduced fertility and birth defects. Both occupational and environmental exposures to pesticides are important, as many are endocrine disruptors, which means that even very low-dose exposure levels may have measurable biological effects. The aim of this review was to summarize the knowledge collected between 2000 and 2020, to highlight new findings, and to further interpret the mechanisms that may associate pesticides with infertility, abnormal sexual maturation, and pregnancy complications associated with occupational, environmental and transplacental exposures. A summary of current pesticide production and usage legislation is also included in order to elucidate the potential impact on exposure profile differences between countries, which may inform prevention measures.

A prioritisation strategy was necessary to determine and meet the most important needs of both policy makers and risk assessors, as well as common national needs of participating countries and a broad range of stakeholders. This strategy consisted of three mains steps: 1) mapping of knowledge gaps identified by policy makers, 2) prioritisation of substances using a scoring system, and 3) generation of a list of priority substances reflective of the scoring, as well as of public policy priorities and available resources.

For the first step, relevant ministries and agencies at EU and national levels, as well as members of the Stakeholder Forum each nominated up to 5 substances/substance groups of concern for policy-makers. These nominations were collated into a preliminary list of 48 substances/substance groups, which was subsequently shortened to a list of 23 after considering the total number of nominations each substance/substance group received and the nature of the nominating entities.

For the second step, a panel of 11 experts in epidemiology, toxicology, exposure sciences, and occupational and environmental health scored each of the substances/substance groups using prioritisation criteria including hazardous properties, exposure characteristics, and societal concern. The scores were used to rank the 23 substances/substance groups. In addition, substances were categorised according to the level of current knowledge about their hazards, extent of human exposure (through the availability of HBM data), regulatory status and availability of analytical methods for biomarker measurement.

Finally, in addition to the ranking and categorisation of the substances, the resources available for the project and the alignment with the policy priorities at European level were considered to produce a final priority list of 9 substances/substance groups for research activities and surveys within the framework of the HBM4EU project.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463921000936?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113778

Breast milk is considered to offer the best nutrition to infants; however, it may be a source of exposure to environmental chemicals such as perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS) for breastfeeding infants. PFAS are a complex group of synthetic chemicals whose high stability has led to their ubiquitous contamination of the environment.

Objective
To assess the concentrations and profiles of PFAS in breast milk from donors to a human milk bank and explore factors potentially related to this exposure.

Methods
Pooled milk samples were collected from 82 donors to the Human Milk Bank of the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital (Granada, Spain). Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was applied to determine milk concentrations of 11 PFAS, including long-chain and short-chain compounds. A questionnaire was used to collect information on donors’ socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, diet, and use of personal care products (PCPs). Factors related to individual and total PFAS concentrations were evaluated by multivariate regression analysis.

Results
PFAS were detected in 24–100% of breast milk samples. PFHpA was detected in 100% of samples, followed by PFOA (84%), PFNA (71%), PFHxA (66%), and PFTrDA (62%). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in only 34% of donors. The median concentrations ranged from <0.66 ng/dL (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]) to 19.39 ng/L (PFHpA). The median of the sum of PFAS concentrations was 87.67 ng/L and was higher for short-chain than long-chain PFAS. Factors most frequently associated with increased PFAS concentrations included intake of creatin animal food items and use of PCPs such as skin care and makeup products.

Conclusions
Several PFAS, including short-chain compounds, are detected in pooled donor milk samples. Breast milk may be an important pathway for the PFAS exposure of breastfed infants, including preterm infants in NICUs. Despite the reduced sample size, these data suggest that various lifestyle factors influence PFAS concentrations, highlighting the use of PCPs.","At least seven PFAS were detected in milk from almost one-third of donors.

PFHpA was detected in milk from all donors.

PFOA, PFNA, and PFHxA were detected in milk from 84, 71, and 66% of donors, respectively.

Concentrations were higher for short-chain PFAS than for long-chain PFAS.

Exposure to Cd at environmental low-exposure levels has been associated with adverse effects such as renal toxicity and more recently bone effects. The implication, even if limited, of Cd in the etiology of osteoporosis can be of high importance at the population level given the significant prevalence of osteoporosis and the ubiquitous and life-long exposure to Cd. Therefore, the osteoporosis cases attributable to Cd exposure was estimated in three European countries (Belgium, France and Spain), based on measured urinary Cd levels from HBM studies conducted in these countries. The targeted population was women over 55 years old, for which risk levels associated with environmental Cd exposure were available. Around 23% of the cases were attributed to Cd exposure. Moreover, in a prospective simulation approach of lifelong urinary Cd concentrations assuming different intakes scenarios, future osteoporosis attributable cases were calculated, based on urinary Cd levels measured in women aged under 55. Between 6 and 34% of the considered populations under 55 years were at risk for osteoporosis. Finally, the costs associated to the burden of osteoporosis-related fractures attributable to Cd for each country targeted in this paper were assessed, standing for a major contributing role of Cd exposure in the overall social costs related to osteoporosis. Absolute costs ranged between 0.12 (low estimate in Belgium) and 2.6 billion Euros (high estimate in France) in women currently over 55 years old and at risk for fractures.

Generally, low cadmium levels in urine and blood of the general population place particularly high demands on quality assurance and control measures (QA/QC) for cadmium determination. One of the aims of the HBM4EU project is to harmonize and advance HBM in Europe. Cadmium is one of the chemicals selected as a priority substance for HBM implementation in the 30 European countries under HBM4EU. For this purpose, analytical comparability and accuracy of the analytical laboratories of participating countries was investigated in a QA/QC programme comprising interlaboratory comparison investigations (ICI) and external quality assurance schemes (EQUAS). This paper presents the evaluation process and discusses the results of four ICI/EQUAS rounds for the determination of cadmium in urine and blood. The majority of the 43 participating laboratories achieved satisfactory results, although low limits of quantification were required to quantify Cd concentrations at general population exposure levels. The relative standard deviation of the participants’ results obtained from all ICI and EQUAS runs ranged from 8 to 36% for cadmium in urine and 8–28% for cadmium in blood. Applying inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), using an internal standard, and eliminating molybdenum oxide interferences was favourable for the accurate determination of cadmium in urine and blood. Furthermore, the analysis of cadmium in urine was found to have a critical point at approximately 0.05 μg/l, below which variability increased and laboratory proficiency decreased.

Urinary metabolites of non-persistent pesticides and serum hormones in Spanish adolescent males.,"Freire C, Suárez B, Vela-Soria F, Castiello F, Reina-Pérez I, Andersen HR, Olea N, Fernández MF",2021-03,,"Objective
To assess the relationship of urinary concentrations of ethylenethiourea (ETU), the main degradation product of ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate fungicides, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common metabolite of many pyrethroids, and 1-naphthol (1N), a metabolite of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl, with hormone concentrations in adolescent males; and to examine interactions between pesticide metabolites and polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, including CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, in relation to hormone concentrations.

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 134 males from the Spanish Environment and Childhood (INMA)-Granada cohort. Urine and serum samples were collected from participants during the same clinical visit at the age of 15–17 years. First morning urine void was analyzed for concentrations of ETU, 3-PBA, and 1N. Serum was analyzed for concentrations of reproductive hormones (testosterone, 17β-estradiol [E2], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS], sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], anti-Müllerian hormone [AMH], and prolactin), thyroid hormones (free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], and thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol. CYP2C19 G681A and CYP2D6 G1846A polymorphisms were determined in blood from 117 participants. Multiple linear regression, interaction terms, and stratified analyses were performed.

Results
Urinary ETU was detected in 74.6% of participants, 1N in 38.1%, and 3-PBA in 19.4%. Positive associations between detectable 3-PBA and TT3 and between detectable 1N and DHEAS were found, and marginally-significant associations of 1N with reduced E2 and FSH were observed. Poor CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 metabolizers (GA and AA genotype carriers) showed a greater increase in DHEAS for detected versus undetected 1N compared with GG genotype carriers. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (1846 GA and AA genotypes) evidenced increased cortisol for detected versus undetected ETU.

Conclusions
The associations observed between urinary pesticide metabolites and altered thyroid and reproductive hormones are novel and should be verified in studies with larger sample size.

Network Analysis to Identify Communities Among Multiple Exposure Biomarkers Measured at Birth in Three Flemish General Population Samples,"lse Ottenbros, Eva Govarts, Erik Lebret, Roel Vermeulen, Greet Schoeters, Jelle Vlaanderen",2021-02,"network analysis, human biomonitoring, multiple exposure biomarkers, mixtures, risk assessment, community detection","Introduction: Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns. Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata within datasets.

Methods: We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years resp. 2002–2004, 2008–2009, and 2013–2014). Measured biomarkers were multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.

Results: Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers, “communities,” within these networks highlighted which biomarkers should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.

Conclusion: Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture risk assessment approaches.",,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.590038/full,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.590038
Human biomonitoring initiative (HBM4EU): Human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs) derived for bisphenol A,"Eva Ougier, Florence Zeman, Jean-Philippe Antignac, Christophe Rousselle, Rosa Lange, Marike Kolossa-Gehring, Petra Apel",2021-04,Human biomonitoring (HBM); HBM4EU; Internal exposure; Biomarkers; Endocrine disruptor; Bisphenol A (BPA); Human biomonitoring guidance value (HBM-GV); Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK),"The “European Human Biomonitoring Initiative” (HBM4EU) derives human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs) for the general population (HBM-GVGenPop) and/or for occupationally exposed adults (HBM-GVWorker) for several priority substances and substance groups as identified by policy makers, scientists and stakeholders at EU and national level, including bisphenol A (BPA).

Human exposure to BPA is widespread and of particular concern because of its known endocrine-disrupting properties. Unlike the conjugated forms of BPA circulating in the body, free BPA is known to interact with the nuclear estrogen receptors. Because free BPA is considered to be more toxicologically active than the conjugated forms (e.g. BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPA-sulfate (BPA-S)), its measurement in blood provides the superior surrogate of the biologically effective dose. However, considering the difficulty of implementing blood sampling in large HBM cohorts, as well as the current analytical capacities complying with the quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC) schemes, total BPA in urine (i.e. the sum of free and conjugated forms of BPA measured after an hydrolysis of phase II metabolites) was retained as the relevant exposure biomarker for BPA.

HBM-GVGenPop for total BPA in urine of 230 µg/L and 135 µg/L for adults and children, respectively, were developed on the basis of toxicological data. To derive these values, the concentrations of urinary total BPA consistent with a steady-state exposure to the temporary Tolerable Daily Intake (t-TDI) of 4 µg/kg bw/day set in 2015 by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) were estimated. The BPA human physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed by Karrer et al. (2018) was used, assuming an oral exposure to BPA at the t-TDI level averaged over 24 h. Dermal uptake of BPA is suspected to contribute substantially to the total BPA body burden, which in comparison with the oral route, is generating a higher ratio of free BPA to total BPA in blood. Therefore, an alternative approach for calculating the HBM-GVGenPop according to the estimated relative contributions of both the oral and dermal routes to the global BPA exposure is also discussed.

Regarding BPA exposure at the workplace, the steady-state concentration of urinary total BPA was estimated after a dermal uptake of BPA that would generate the same concentration of free BPA in plasma (considered as the bioactive form) as would a 24 h-averaged intake to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)’s oral DNEL of 8 µg BPA/kg bw/day set for workers. The predicted concentration of urinary total BPA at steady-state is equivalent to, or exceeds the 95th percentile of total BPA in urine measured in different European HBM studies conducted in the general population. Thus, no HBM-GVWorker was proposed, as the high background level of BPA coming from environmental exposure - mostly through food intake - is making the discrimination with the occupational exposure to BPA difficult.","HBM-GVs of 230 µg/L and 135 µg/L urinary total BPA derived for adults and children from the general population, respectively.

Rodent studies show reverse effects, i.e. decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring however at PFAS serum levels at least 100-fold higher than those in humans. This paper aims to present the main issues regarding the modulation of lipid homeostasis by the two most common PFASs, PFOS and PFOA, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms relevant for humans. Overall, the apparent contrast between human and animal data may be an artifact of dose, with different molecular pathways coming into play upon exposure to PFASs at very low versus high levels. Altogether, the interpretation of existing rodent data on PFOS/PFOA-induced lipid perturbations with respect to the human situation is complex. From a mechanistic perspective, research on human liver cells shows that PFOS/PFOA activate the PPARα pathway, whereas studies on the involvement of other nuclear receptors, like PXR, are less conclusive. Other data indicate that suppression of the nuclear receptor HNF4α signaling pathway, as well as perturbations of bile acid metabolism and transport might be important cellular events that require further investigation. Future studies with human-relevant test systems would help to obtain more insight into the mechanistic pathways pertinent for humans.

Fernandez, Ludek Blaha",2021-04,Endocrine disruption; Nuclear receptors; Steroid hormones; Flame retardants; Emerging contaminants; ToxCast,"Background and aim
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) constitute a major public health concern because they can induce a large spectrum of adverse effects by interfering with the hormonal system. Rapid identification of potential EDCs using in vitro screenings is therefore critical, particularly for chemicals of emerging concerns such as replacement flame retardants (FRs). The review aimed at identifying (1) data gaps and research needs regarding endocrine disrupting (ED) properties of replacement FRs and (2) potential EDCs among these emerging chemicals.

Methods
A systematic search was performed from open literature and ToxCast/Tox21 programs, and results from in vitro tests on the activities of 52 replacement FRs towards five hormone nuclear receptors (NRs) associated with reproductive outcomes (estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and aryl hydrocarbon receptors) were compiled and organized into tables. Findings were complemented with information from structure-based in silico model predictions and in vivo information when relevant.

Results
For the majority of the 52 replacement FRs, experimental in vitro data on activities towards these five NRs were either incomplete (15 FRs) or not found (24 FRs). Within the replacement FRs for which effect data were found, some appeared as candidate EDCs, such as triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and tris(1,3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP). The search also revealed shared ED profiles. For example, anti-androgenic activity was reported for 19 FRs and predicted for another 21 FRs.

Discussion
This comprehensive review points to critical gaps in knowledge on ED potential for many replacement FRs, including chemicals to which the general population is likely exposed. Although this review does not cover all possible characteristics of ED, it allowed the identification of potential EDCs associated with reproductive outcomes, calling for deeper evaluation and possibly future regulation of these chemicals. By identifying shared ED profiles, this work also raises concerns for mixture effects since the population is co-exposed to several FRs and other chemicals.","Critical lack of data for many replacement FRs ubiquitous and high tonnage.

A Suspect Screening Database for Chemicals of Emerging Concern in Exposome Research.,"Meijer J, Lamoree M, Hamers T, Antignac JP, Hutinet S, Debrauwer L, Covaci A, Huber C, Krauss M, Walker DI, Schymanski EL, Vermeulen R, Vlaanderen J.",2021-03,Annotation database; High-resolution mass spectrometry; Chemicals of emerging concern; Exposome research,"Background
Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) include a very wide group of chemicals that are suspected to be responsible for adverse effects on health, but for which very limited information is available. Chromatographic techniques coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be used for non-targeted screening and detection of CECs, by using comprehensive annotation databases. Establishing a database focused on the annotation of CECs in human samples will provide new insight into the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of CECs in humans.

Objectives
This study describes an approach for the aggregation and curation of an annotation database (CECscreen) for the identification of CECs in human biological samples.

Methods
The approach consists of three main parts. First, CECs compound lists from various sources were aggregated and duplications and inorganic compounds were removed. Subsequently, the list was curated by standardization of structures to create “MS-ready” and “QSAR-ready” SMILES, as well as calculation of exact masses (monoisotopic and adducts) and molecular formulas. The second step included the simulation of Phase I metabolites. The third and final step included the calculation of QSAR predictions related to physicochemical properties, environmental fate, toxicity and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) processes and the retrieval of information from the US EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard.

Results
All CECscreen database and property files are publicly available (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3956586). In total, 145,284 entries were aggregated from various CECs data sources. After elimination of duplicates and curation, the pipeline produced 70,397 unique “MS-ready” structures and 66,071 unique QSAR-ready structures, corresponding with 69,526 CAS numbers. Simulation of Phase I metabolites resulted in 306,279 unique metabolites. QSAR predictions could be performed for 64,684 of the QSAR-ready structures, whereas information was retrieved from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard for 59,739 CAS numbers out of 69,526 inquiries. CECscreen is incorporated in the in silico fragmentation approach MetFrag.

Discussion
The CECscreen database can be used to prioritize annotation of CECs measured in non-targeted HRMS, facilitating the large-scale detection of CECs in human samples for exposome research. Large-scale detection of CECs can be further improved by integrating the present database with resources that contain CECs (metabolites) and meta-data measurements, further expansion towards in silico and experimental (e.g., MassBank) generation of MS/MS spectra, and development of bioinformatics approaches capable of using correlation patterns in the measured chemical features.","CECscreen is an annotation database for CECs in human biological samples.

Biomarkers of effect as determined in human biomonitoring studies on hexavalent chromium and cadmium in the period 2008-2020,"Célia Ventura, Bruno Costa Gomes, Axel Oberemm, Henriqueta Louro, Pasi Huuskonen, Vicente Mustieles, Mariana F. Fernández, Sophie Ndaw, Marcel Mengelers, Mirjam Luijten, Claudia Gundacker, Maria João Silva",2021-03,Toxic metals;Cancer;Oxidative stress;Nephrotoxicity;Immunotoxicity;Mode of action;Adverse outcome pathway (AOP),"A number of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented data on exposure to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and cadmium (Cd), but comparatively few include results on effect biomarkers. The latter are needed to identify associations between exposure and adverse outcomes (AOs) in order to assess public health implications. To support improved derivation of EU regulation and policy making, it is of great importance to identify the most reliable effect biomarkers for these heavy metals that can be used in HBM studies. In the framework of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative, our study aim was to identify effect biomarkers linking Cr(VI) and Cd exposure to selected AOs including cancer, immunotoxicity, oxidative stress, and omics/epigenetics. A comprehensive PubMed search identified recent HBM studies, in which effect biomarkers were examined. Validity and applicability of the markers in HBM studies are discussed. The most frequently analysed effect biomarkers regarding Cr(VI) exposure and its association with cancer were those indicating oxidative stress (e.g., 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) and DNA or chromosomal damage (comet and micronucleus assays). With respect to Cd and to some extent Cr, β-2-microglobulin (B2-MG) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) are well-established, sensitive, and the most common effect biomarkers to relate Cd or Cr exposure to renal tubular dysfunction. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 could serve as sensitive biomarkers of acute kidney injury in response to both metals, but need further investigation in HBM studies. Omics-based biomarkers, i.e., changes in the (epi-)genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome associated with Cr and/or Cd exposure, are promising effect biomarkers, but more HBM data are needed to confirm their significance. The combination of established effect markers and omics biomarkers may represent the strongest approach, especially if based on knowledge of mechanistic principles. To this aim, also mechanistic data were collected to provide guidance on the use of more sensitive and specific effect biomarkers. This also led to the identification of knowledge gaps relevant to the direction of future research.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121002929?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110998

Until today, metabolites are detected in almost every urine sample analysed. This raised the urgent need for a toxicological interpretation of the internal exposure levels. The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) contributes substantially to the knowledge on the actual exposure of European citizens to chemicals prioritised within HBM4EU, on their potential impact on health and on the interpretation of these data to improve policy making. On that account, human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs) are derived for the general population and the occupationally exposed population agreed at HBM4EU consortium level. These values can be used to assess phthalate exposure levels measured in HBM studies in a health risk assessment context. HBM-GVs were derived for five phthalates (DEHP, DnBP, DiBP, BBzP and DPHP) and for the non-phthalate substitute Hexamoll® DINCH. For the adult general population, the HBM-GVs for the specific metabolite(s) of the respective parent compounds in urine are the following: 0.5 mg/L for the sum of 5-oxo-MEHP and 5-OH-MEHP; 0.19 mg/L for MnBP, 0.23 mg/L for MiBP; 3 mg/L for MBzP; 0.5 mg/L for the sum of oxo-MPHP and OH-MPHP and 4.5 mg/L for the sum of OH-MINCH and cx-MINCH.

The substance groups considered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization.

To date, unlike in other research fields such as forensics or food analysis, there is a lack of guidelines for non-target analysis in human risk assessment and quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols. Moreover, the majority of efforts have been focused on the development and implementation of QA/QC actions for data acquisition, data analysis and mining, largely neglecting the sample preparation necessary for determination of CECs by suspect and non-target screening methods.

In this article, we propose a set of QA/QC measures that covers sampling, sample preparation and data acquisition, as an aspect of work conducted within the European Biomonitoring for Europe initiative (HBM4EU).

As part of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) Project, we aimed to examine the combined biological activity of chemical mixtures extracted from human placentas using one in vivo and four in vitro bioassays, also known as biomarkers of combined effect. Relevant endocrine activities (proliferative and/or reporter gene assays) and four endpoints were tested: the estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activities, as well as thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Correlations among bioassays and their functional shapes were evaluated. Results showed that all placental extracts agonized or antagonized at least three of the abovementioned endpoints. Most placentas induced ER-mediated transactivation and ER-dependent cell proliferation, together with a strong inhibition of TH signaling and the AR transactivity; while the induction of the AhR was found in only one placental extract. The effects in the two estrogenic bioassays were positively and significantly correlated and the AR-antagonism activity showed a positive borderline-significant correlation with both estrogenic bioassay activities. However, the in vivo anti-thyroid activities of placental extracts were not correlated with any of the tested in vitro assays.

We also discuss the role of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework and physiologically based kinetic and dynamic (PBK/D) modelling to strengthen the understanding of the biological mechanism of effect biomarkers, and in particular for use in regulatory risk assessments. An interdisciplinary network of experts from the European chapter of the International Society for Exposure Science (ISES Europe) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Occupational Biomonitoring activity of Working Parties of Hazard and Exposure Assessment group worked together to map the conventional framework of biomarkers and provided recommendations for their systematic use.

Several effect biomarkers, especially for use in occupational settings, are validated. They offer a direct assessment of the overall health risks associated with exposure to chemicals, chemical mixtures and their transformation products. Promising novel effect biomarkers are emerging for biomonitoring of the general population. Efforts are being dedicated to prioritizing molecular and biochemical effect biomarkers that can provide a causal link in exposure-health outcome associations. This mechanistic approach has great potential in improving human health risk assessment. New techniques such as in silico methods (e.g. QSAR, PBK/D modelling) as well as ‘omics data will aid this process.

Our multidisciplinary review represents a starting point for enhancing the identification of effect biomarkers and their mechanistic pathways following the AOP framework. This may help in prioritizing the effect biomarker implementation as well as defining threshold limits for chemical mixtures in a more structured way. Several ex vivo biomarkers have been proposed to evaluate combined effects including genotoxicity and xeno-estrogenicity. There is a regulatory need to derive effect-based trigger values using the increasing mechanistic knowledge coming from the AOP framework to address adverse health effects due to exposure to chemical mixtures.

The methodology agreed within the framework of the HBM4EU project is used in this work to derive HBM-GVs for the general population (HBM-GVGenPop) and for workers (HBM-GVWorker) exposed to cadmium (Cd) and its compounds.

Methods
For Cd, a significant number of epidemiological studies with dose–response relationships are available, in particular for kidney effects. These effects are described in terms of a relation between urinary Cd (U-Cd) or blood Cd (B-Cd) levels and low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) markers like beta-2-microglobulin (β2M) and retinol-binding protein (RBP). In order to derive HBM-GVs for the general population and workers, an assessment of data from evaluations conducted by national or international organisations was undertaken. In this work, it appeared relevant to select renal effects as the critical effect for the both groups, however, differences between general population (including sensitive people) and workers (considered as an homogenous population of adults who should not be exposed to Cd if they suffer from renal diseases) required the selection of different key studies (i.e. conducted in general population for HBM-GVGenPop and at workplace for HBM-GVWorker).

Results and conclusions
For U-Cd, a HBM-GVGenPop of 1 µg/g creatinine (creat) is recommended for adults older than 50 years, based on a robust meta-analysis performed by EFSA (EFSA, 2009a). To take into account the accumulation of Cd in the human body throughout life, threshold or ‘alert’ values according to age were estimated for U-Cd. At workplace, a HBM-GVWorker of 2 μg/g creat is derived from the study of Chaumont et al., (2011) for U-Cd, and in addition to this recommendation a HBM-GVworker for B-Cd of 5 µg/L is also proposed. The HBM-GVWorker for U-Cd is similar to the biological limit value (BLV) set by the new amendment of the European Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive in June 2019 (2 µg/g creat for U-Cd).","Derivation of Human Biomonitoring Guidance values (HBM-GVs) for Cadmium.

Human biomonitoring (HBM) studies like other epidemiological studies are costly and time-consuming. They require the administration of questionnaires and collection of biological samples, putting substantial burden on the participants which may result in low participation rates. The growing importance of HBM studies in epidemiology, exposure assessment and risk assessment underline the importance of optimizing study planning, designing and implementation thus minimizing the above-mentioned difficulties.

Methods
Based on frameworks from survey design and fieldwork preparation of the European Joint Program HBM4EU, the German Environment Surveys and the COPHES/DEMOCOPHES twin projects combined with elements of project management strategies, a Phased Approach has been developed, introducing a step-by-step guideline for the development of epidemiological studies.

Results
The Phased Approach splits the process of developing a study into six phases: Phase 0 (Scoping and Planning): All aspects that are necessary to conduct a study are compiled and put on the agenda for decision-making. Phase 1 (Preparation and Testing): Instruments (e.g. questionnaires), materials (e.g. guidelines, information), and ethics and data management issues, needing thorough preparation and testing before a study can start. Phase 2 (Initiation): Organization and acquisition of necessary equipment and engaging and training personnel. Phase 3 (Implementation): All procedures that require temporal proximity to the start date of fieldwork, such as obtaining contact information of invitees. Phase 4 (Fieldwork and Analysis): Involvement of participants and chemical analysis of the collected samples. Phase 5 (Results and Evaluation): Final procedures leading to closure of the project, such as providing and communicating results.

Conclusions
The separation of the planning and conduct of human biomonitoring studies into different phases creates the basis for a structured procedure and facilitates a step-by-step approach reducing costs, warranting high participation rates and increasing quality of conduct. Emphasis is put on a comprehensive scoping phase ensuring high quality of the study design, which is indispensable for reliable results.

The method was focused on human milk to investigate mother and newborn exposure to known organic contaminants and to extend the characterisation to unknown compounds. We specifically focused on halogenated biomarkers of exposure due to persistence and potential toxicological impact reasons. The newly developed approach was based on a simple and fast sample preparation followed by a comprehensive analysis by both liquid and gas phase chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. Critical steps of the non-targeted workflow as the method assessment have been addressed with a reference mix of 30 chlorinated and brominated contaminants encompassing various substances groups and a statistical approach.

The European initiative HBM4EU has prioritized seven substance groups and two metals relevant for human exposure: Phthalates and substitutes (1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester, DINCH), bisphenols, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), halogenated and organophosphorous flame retardants (HFRs and OPFRs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), arylamines, cadmium and chromium. As a first step towards comparable European-wide data, the most suitable biomarkers, human matrices and analytical methods for each substance group or metal were selected from the scientific literature, based on a set of selection criteria. The biomarkers included parent compounds of PFASs and HFRs in serum, of bisphenols and arylamines in urine, metabolites of phthalates, DINCH, OPFRs and PAHs in urine as well as metals in blood and urine, with a preference to measure Cr in erythrocytes representing Cr (VI) exposure. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was the method of choice for bisphenols, PFASs, the HFR hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), phenolic HFRs as well as the metabolites of phthalates, DINCH, OPFRs and PAHs in urine. Gas chromatographic (GC) methods were selected for the remaining compounds, e.g. GC-low resolution MS with electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) for HFRs. Both GC–MS and LC-MS/MS were suitable for arylamines. New developments towards increased applications of GC–MS/MS may offer alternatives to GC–MS or LC-MS/MS approaches, e.g. for bisphenols. The metals were best determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS, with the particular challenge of avoiding interferences in the Cd determination in urine.

Estimating human exposure to pyrethroids' mixtures from biomonitoring data using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.,Paul Quindroit; Amélie Crépet; Céline Brochot,2020-10,,"Human biomonitoring data provide evidence to exposure of environmental chemicals. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling together with an adequate exposure scenario allows to transpose measured concentrations of chemicals or their metabolites into exposure levels, as daily intakes. In France, high levels of urinary pyrethroids metabolites have been measured in populations. Our work aims at estimating the exposure of the French ENNS cohort to mixtures of four pyrethroids (deltamethrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, and cyfluthrin) from the urinary concentrations of five pyrethroids' metabolites commonly measured in biomonitoring studies. We developed a modelling approach based on a global toxicokinetic model that accounts for the cumulative exposure to pyrethroids as some of the metabolites can be shared by several parent compounds and for human inter-individual variability in metabolism. The median of the individual daily intakes was estimated to 8.1 ng/kg bw/day for permethrin, 17.7 ng/kg bw/day for cypermethrin, 20.4 ng/kg bw/day for cyfluthrin and 34.3 ng/kg bw/day for deltamethrin leading to similar weights for the pair permethrin and cypermethrin (36%), cyfluthrin (31%) and deltamethrin (33%) to the cumulative exposure. Accounting for human variability enabled to explain some of the variations in the metabolites' levels within the cohort. The cumulative exposure was then weighted by their toxicities towards three neurotoxic effects to calculate margins of exposure (MOE). Low MOE values were always associated with high measured concentrations of metabolites in urine and the lowest MOEs were observed for the autonomic division. No risks associated with reconstructed mixtures of pyrethroids were expected for the ENNS cohort. Our approach is an asset to analyse the biomarkers of exposure to pyrethroids simultaneously and could be easily adapted to any local or national specificities in pyrethroids’ exposure or populations.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935120311786?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110281

PFAAs are hormone-disrupting compounds that are strongly suspected to affect mother-child-health such as fetal growth. Thyroid disruption is a plausible mechanism of action. We aim to summarize the epidemiological evidence for the relation between prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFAAs and disruption of thyroid homeostasis in mothers and/or infants. Method: Fifteen original publications on PFAAs concentrations and thyroid hormones (TH) in pregnant women and/or infants were found upon a literature search in the PubMed database. Information on exposure to seven PFAAs congeners [Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA)] and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (FT4 and TT4), free and total triiodothyronine (FT3 and TT3), T3RU (Free triiodothyronine resin uptake) and FT4-index (FT4I) levels were recorded. We evaluated sampling of maternal TH by trimester, and infant TH by sex stratification. Reported associations between mother or infant PFAAs and TH were not uniformly assessed in the selected studies. Results: Ten out of the fifteen studies examined maternal PFAAs concentration and TSH level. Seven studies showed significant associations between TSH and exposure to six PFAAs congeners, most of them were positive. Maternal T4 and T3 were investigated in nine studies and five studies found inverse associations between exposure to six PFAAs congeners and TH (TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 and FT4I) levels. Eight of the fifteen studies investigated PFAAs concentrations and infant TSH. Infant TSH level was significantly affected in four studies, positively in three studies. Nine studies investigated infant T4 and T3 and seven studies found significant associations with PFAAs exposure. However, both inverse and positive significant associations with infant TH were found eliciting no clear direction. Conclusion: Results indicate a mainly positive relationship between maternal PFAAs concentrations and TSH levels, and suggestion of an inverse association with T4 and/or T3 levels. Associations of infant TH with PFAAs concentration were less consistent.",,https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1186/s12940-020-00647-1?sharing_token=wgoaemcLb4W3BjKIuUhEn2_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RNARfAMB7jOSGhmDC3JpgLuMAwv58oCh3hmaxHOFcRVCof22QfuDJXAX9pe9eTcAJVfgYINy9zylvABAX7uhs0qQvHubkXVWjMPHrxI5IMcObg9nUs2bx_T_Ltg2y6bHlY%3D,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00647-1

There is growing concern that human exposure to chemical mixtures, especially during critical periods of development, increases the risk of adverse health effects in newborns or later in life. Historically, the one-chemical-at-a-time approach has been applied both for exposure assessment and hazard characterisation, leading to insufficient knowledge about human health effects caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals that have the same target. To circumvent this challenge researchers can apply in vitro assays to analyse both exposure to and human health effects of chemical mixtures in biological samples. The advantages of using in vitro assays are: (i) that an integrated effect is measured, taking combined mixture effects into account and (ii) that in vitro assays can reduce complexity in identification of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) in human tissues.

We have reviewed the state-of-the-art on the use of receptor-based in vitro assays to assess human exposure to chemical mixtures and related health impacts. A total of 43 studies were identified, in which endpoints for the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the androgen receptor (AR) were used. The majority of studies reported biological activities that could be associated with breast cancer incidence, male reproductive health effects, developmental toxicities, human demographic characteristics or lifestyle factors such as dietary patterns. A few studies used the bioactivities to check the coverage of the chemical analyses of the human samples, whereas in vitro assays have so far not regularly been used for identifying CECs in human samples, but rather in environmental matrices or food packaging materials.

A huge field of novel applications using receptor-based in vitro assays for mixture toxicity assessment on human samples and effect-directed analysis (EDA) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for identification of toxic compounds waits for exploration. In the future this could lead to a paradigm shift in the way we unravel adverse human health effects caused by chemical mixtures.","Human exposure to chemical cocktails demands new technologies to assess this combined exposure.

During the last decade, the European Union initiated several projects in the domains of public and environmental health. Within this framework, BRIDGE Health (Bridging Information and Data Generation for Evidence-based Health policy and Research) and HBM4EU (European human biomonitoring initiative) have been implemented. Whereas, the focus of BRIDGE Health was towards a sustainable and integrated health information system (HIS), the aim of HBM4EU is to improve evidence of the internal exposure of European citizens to environmental chemicals by human biomonitoring (HBM) and the impact of internal exposure on health. As both, environmental and public health determinants are important for health promotion, disease prevention and policy, BRIDGE Health and HBM4EU have overlapping aims and outcomes. In order to improve health information regarding public health and environmental health issues, best use and exchange of respective networks and project results is necessary.

Methods
Both projects have implemented health information (HI) and HBM tasks in order to provide adequate environmental and public health information of the European population. Synergies of the projects were identified in the working progress and because of overlapping networks and experts a focused analysis of both projects was envisaged. This paper elaborates on the aims and outcomes of both projects and the benefit of merging and channelling research results for the use of better health information and policy making that may be of relevance for any other project in these research fields.

Results
The need for focused exchanges and collaborations between the projects were identified and benefits of exchanges were highlighted for the specific areas of indicator development, linkage of data repositories and the combination of HBM studies and health examination surveys (HES). Further recommendations for a European wide harmonisation among different tasks in the fields of public health and environmental health are being developed.

Conclusions
Lessons learned from HBM4EU and BRIDGE Health show that continuous efforts must be undertaken, also by succeeding projects, to guarantee the exchange between public health and environmental health issues. Networks covering both are essential to provide better evidence of knowledge. The experiences from BRIDGE Health and HBM4EU give a valuable input for any future activity in these domains. Avoiding overlaps and streamlining further exchange of public health and environmental health contributes to best use of research results and allows to develop new strategies and tools for improvement of health information and thus enhances people’s health and well-being.",,https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-020-00460-9,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00460-9

One important outcome will be a Europe-wide improvement and harmonization of health risk assessment following the coordinated derivation or update of health-related guidance values referring to the internal body burden. These guidance values - named HBM guidance values or HBM-GVs - can directly be compared with HBM data. They are derived within HBM4EU for priority substances identified by the HBM4EU chemicals prioritization strategy based on existing needs to answer policy relevant questions as raised by national and EU policy makers. HBM-GVs refer to both the general population and occupationally exposed adults. Reports including the detailed reasoning for the values' proposals are subjected to a consultation process within all partner countries of the consortium to reach a broad scientific consensus on the derivation approach and on the derived values. The final HBM-GVs should be applied first within the HBM4EU project, but may also be useful for regulators and risk assessors outside this project. The subsequent adoption of derived HBM-GVs at EU-level needs to be discussed and decided within the responsible EU bodies. Nevertheless, the establishment of HBM-GVs as part of HBM4EU is already a step forward in strengthening HBM-based policy efforts for public and occupational health.

One of these approaches is biomonitoring (BM), which provides unequivocal evidence that both exposure and uptake of a chemical have taken place. BM has been a longstanding practice in occupational health for several reasons. BM integrates exposure from all routes. It can help identify unintentional and unexpected exposures and assess the effectiveness of existing risk-management measures. BM also provides relevant information to support policy development by delivering better evidence of workers’ exposure to chemical substances, even within the framework of the present regulations. Thus, BM can allow for both the evaluation of the impact of regulation and identification of further needs for new or improved regulation. However, despite all these well-recognized advantages, BM is currently an underused exposure assessment tool. This paper provides an overview of the key aspects to be considered when using BM in the context of occupational health interventions. Additionally, this paper describes the potential of BM as an exposure assessment tool, distinguishing the role of BM in exposure assessment and health surveillance and clarifies ethical and communication aspects to guarantee that general data protection regulations are followed.

Phthalates, a group of ubiquitous industrial chemicals, have been widely used in occupational settings, mainly as plasticizers in a variety of applications. Occupational exposure to different phthalates has been studied in several occupational settings using human biomonitoring (HBM).

Aim
To provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on occupational exposure to phthalates assessed using HBM and to determine future data needs on the topic as part of the HBM4EU project.

Methods
A systematic search was carried out in the databases of Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2000 and September 4, 2019 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 22 studies on the occupational HBM of phthalates was considered suitable for review.

Results and discussion
Among the reviewed studies, 19 (86%) focused on DEHP, an old phthalate that is now subject to authorization and planned to be restricted in the EU. Concentrations of MEHHP, one of its metabolites, varied up to 13-fold between studies and across sectors when comparing extreme geometric means, ranging from 11.6 (similar to the general populations) to 151 μg/g creatinine. Only 2 studies focused on newer phthalates such as DiNP and DPHP. Concerning the geographical distribution, 10 studies were performed in Europe (including 6 in Slovakia), 8 in Asia, and 4 in North America, but this distribution is not a good reflection of phthalate production and usage levels worldwide. Most HBM studies were performed in the context of PVC product manufacturing. Future studies should focus on: i) a more uniform approach to sampling timing to facilitate comparisons between studies; ii) newer phthalates; and iii) old phthalates in waste management or recycling.

Conclusion
Our findings highlight the lack of recent occupational HBM studies on both old and new phthalate exposure in European countries and the need for a harmonized approach. Considering the important policy actions taken in Europe regarding phthalates, it seems relevant to evaluate the impact of these actions on exposure levels and health risks for workers.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920300316?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113548

PubMed database searches identified 27 relevant articles that were used for data extraction. In all studies, BPA exposure was reported, whereas some studies also reported other bisphenols. More than a dozen different biomarkers were measured. The most frequently measured biomarkers were 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-isoprostane) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which almost always were positively associated with BPA. Methodological issues were reported for MDA, mainly the need to handle samples with caution to avoid artefact formation and its measurements using a chromatographic step to distinguish it from similar aldehydes, making some of the MDA results less reliable. Urinary 8-OHdG and 8-isoprostane can be considered the most reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress associated with BPA exposure.

This study was aimed at biomonitoring bisphenol A (BPA) and 5 more BP analogues (BPB, BPE, BPF, BPAF and BPZ) in spot urine and blood samples of a cohort of adults, who followed a diet based on a high consumption of canned food. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at assessing the co-exposure of BP analogues in food and biological samples after a two-day duplicate diet study. The estimated total dietary exposure was 0.37 and 0.045 µg/kg body weight/day, for the canned-diet and control groups, respectively. BPA was the compound with the highest concentration in urine in comparison with the values of the remaining BP analogues. A high detection rate of BPA was noted in urine for both groups, 96% for the canned-diet group and 90% for the control group, while in blood it could be only quantified in 6% of the samples. The identification of other analogues was hardly related to diet, so it could be the result of other potential exposure sources, such as personal care products (PCPs) or air inhalation. After 2 days, the excretion of BPA was considerably higher in the canned-diet group subjects than those in the control group (7.02 vs. 1.89 µg/day), confirming that diet and canned foodstuffs are the main route of exposure to BPA. Anyhow, the temporary tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) established by the EFSA was not exceeded, even by those consumers with a diet rich in canned food. Moreover, spot urine samples provided accurate information about exposure and excretion of BPA, being the 4 h, instead of 24 h, the optimal sampling interval, when the collection of spot urine samples is not possible.","Despite the strong regulation, BPA is still widespread in food materials.

Furthermore, these screening approaches have the promising capability to detect chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), document the extent of human chemical exposure, generate new research hypotheses and provide early warning support to policy. Whilst of growing importance in the environment and food safety areas, respectively, CECs remain poorly addressed in the field of human biomonitoring. This shortfall is due to several scientific and methodological reasons, including a global lack of harmonisation. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to present an overview of the basic principles, promises and challenges of suspect and non-targeted screening approaches applied to human samples as this specific field introduce major specificities compared to other fields. Focused on liquid chromatography coupled to HRMS-based data acquisition methods, this overview addresses all steps of these new analytical workflows. Beyond this general picture, the main activities carried out on this topic within the particular framework of the European Human Biomonitoring initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017–2021) are described, with an emphasis on harmonisation measures.","Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) are a growing concern in HBM.

Suspect and non-targeted screening (NTS) approaches offer new capabilities for capturing CECs in human matrices.

These new approaches applied to HBM come with a number of technical and scientific issues to be addressed.

Harmonisation is required at international level to reinforce NTS methods comparability and performance assessment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019338310,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105545
Biomonitoring for occupational exposure to diisocyanates: a systematic review,"Bernice Scholten, Laura Kenny, Radu-Corneliu Duca, Anjoeka Pronk, Tiina Santonen, Karen S Galea, Miranda Loh, Katriina Huumonen, Anne Sleeuwenhoek, Matteo Creta, Lode Godderis, Kate Jones",2020-04,"biomarker, biomonitoring, diisocyanates, review, worker","Diisocyanates are a group of chemicals that are widely used in occupational settings. They are known to induce various health effects, including skin- and respiratory tract sensitization resulting in allergic dermatitis and asthma. Exposure to diisocyanates has been studied in the past decades by using different types of biomonitoring markers and matrices. The aim of this review as part of the HBM4EU project was to assess: (i) which biomarkers and matrices have been used for biomonitoring diisocyanates and what are their strengths and limitations; (ii) what are (current) biomonitoring levels of the major diisocyanates (and metabolites) in workers; and (iii) to characterize potential research gaps. For this purpose we conducted a systematic literature search for the time period 2000–end 2018, thereby focussing on three types of diisocyanates which account for the vast majority of the total isocyanate market volume: hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI), and 4,4′-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). A total of 28 publications were identified which fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies (93%) investigated the corresponding diamines in either urine or plasma, but adducts have also been investigated by several research groups. Studies on HDI were mostly in the motor vehicle repair industry [with urinary hexamethylene diamine result ranging from 0.03 to 146.5 µmol mol−1 creatinine]. For TDI, there is mostly data on foam production [results for urinary toluene diamine ranging from ~0.01 to 97 µmol mol−1 creatinine] whereas the available MDI data are mainly from the polyurethane industry (results for methylenediphenyl diamine range from 0.01 to 32.7 µmol mol−1 creatinine). About half of the studies published were prior to 2010 hence might not reflect current workplace exposure. There is large variability within and between studies and across sectors which could be potentially explained by several factors including worker or workplace variability, short half-lives of biomarkers, and differences in sampling strategies and analytical techniques. We identified several research gaps which could further be taken into account when studying diisocyanates biomonitoring levels: (i) the development of specific biomarkers is promising (e.g. to study oligomers of HDI which have been largely neglected to date) but needs more research before they can be widely applied, (ii) since analytical methods differ between studies a more uniform approach would make comparisons between studies easier, and (iii) dermal absorption seems a possible exposure route and needs to be further investigated. The use of MDI, TDI, and HDI has been recently proposed to be restricted in the European Union unless specific conditions for workers’ training and risk management measures apply. This review has highlighted the need for a harmonized approach to establishing a baseline against which the success of the restriction can be evaluated.",,https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/64/6/569/5822987?login=false,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa038
Relying on repeated biospecimens to reduce the effects of classical-type exposure measurement error in studies linking the exposome to health,"Lydiane Agier, Rémy Slama, Xavier Basagaña",2020-04,,"The exposome calls for assessing numerous exposures, typically using biomarkers with varying amounts of measurement error, which can be assumed to be of classical type. We evaluated the impact of classical-type measurement error on the performance of exposome-health studies, and the efficiency of two measurement error correction methods relying on the collection of repeated biospecimens: within-subject biospecimens pooling and regression calibration. In a simulation study, we generated 237 exposures from a realistic correlation matrix, with various amounts of classical-type measurement error, and a continuous health outcome linearly influenced by exposures. Measurement error decreased the sensitivity to identify exposures influencing health from a value of 75% down to 46%, increased false discovery proportion from 26% to 49% and increased attenuation bias in the slope of true predictors from 45% to 66%. Assuming that repeated biospecimens were available, within-subject pooling and regression calibration improved sensitivity (which increased to 63%), false discovery proportion (down to 37%) and bias (down to 49%) compared to an error-prone study with a single biospecimen per subject. Performances were poorer for the exposures with the largest amount of measurement error, and increased with the number of available biospecimens. Relying on repeated biospecimens only for the exposures with the largest amount of measurement error provided similar performance improvement. Exposome studies relying on spot exposure biospecimens suffer from decreased performances if some biomarkers suffer from measurement error due to their temporal variability; performances can be improved by collecting repeated biospecimens per subject, in particular for non persistent chemicals.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935120303856?via%3Dihub,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109492

To characterize the currently applied storage and shipment procedures within the consortium of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which aims at harmonization of HBM in Europe, a requirement analysis based on data from an online survey was conducted. In addition, the online survey was addressed to professionals in clinical biobanking represented by members of the European, Middle Eastern and African Society for Biopreservation and Biobanking (ESBB) to identify the current state-of-the-art in terms of sample storage and shipment. Results of this survey conducted in these two networks were compared to detect processes with potential for optimization and harmonization. In general, many similarities exist in sample storage and shipment procedures applied by ESBB members and HBM4EU partners and many requirements for ensuring sample quality are already met also by HBM4EU partners. Nevertheless, a need for improvement was identified for individual steps in sample storage, shipment, and related data management with potential impact on sample and data quality for HBM purposes.

Toxicogenomics analyses may provide information about DNA-damaging properties of test compounds but are not routinely used for identification of a genotoxic potential. In this study, metabolically active human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells were exposed to five food-relevant genotoxic carcinogens. Transcriptomic responses were analyzed using RNA sequencing technology and validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Biostatistical approaches revealed a characteristic transcript signature of 37 differentially expressed genes, which were commonly regulated by the test chemicals. Specificity of the transcript signature was confirmed by using non-genotoxic carcinogens as comparators. Pathway analyses showed that the obtained transcript signature was closely related to DNA damage response and p53 activation. In conclusion, we have established a characteristic transcript marker pattern to monitor genotoxicity in human HepaRG cells, and to distinguish genotoxic from non-genotoxic carcinogens.

Humans can be exposed to them via several pathways (inhalation, digestion, dermal exposure). The aim of this study was to assess the concentration of 11 monohydroxylated metabolites of PAHs (OH-PAHs) in 660 urine samples collected from mothers and their newborns residing in two localities of the Czech Republic — Most and Ceske Budejovice — in 2016 and 2017. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the target analytes were extracted from the urine samples using liquid-liquid extraction, with extraction solvent ethyl acetate and a clean-up step using dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) with the Z-Sep sorbent. For identification and quantification, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was applied. 2-OH-NAP was the compound present in all of the measured samples and it was also the compound at the highest concentration in both mothers' and newborns' urine samples (median concentration 5.15 μg/g creatinine and 3.58 μg/g creatinine). The total concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine samples collected from mothers were 2 times higher compared to their children. The most contaminated samples were collected in Most in the period October 2016–March 2017 from both mothers (12.59 μg/g creatinine) and their newborns (8.29 μg/g creatinine). The concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine samples, which were collected from both mothers and their newborns as presented in this study, are comparable with those found in our previous study between 2013 and 2014. In addition, they are slightly lower or comparable to other studies from Poland, USA, Germany, China, and Australia. The results might indicate that the population in the previously highly air-polluted mining districts carries some long-term changes (maybe existing changes in genetic information), which also affect the metabolism of PAHs.

High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is being used increasingly in the context of suspect and non-targeted screening for the identification of bioorganic molecules. There is correspondingly increasing awareness that higher confidence identification will require a systematic, group effort to increase the fraction of compounds with tandem mass spectra available in central, publicly available resources. While typical suspect screening efforts will only result in tentative annotations with a moderate level of confidence, library spectral matches will yield higher confidence or even full confirmation of the identity if the reference standards are available.

Results
This article first explores representative percent coverage of measured tandem mass spectra in selected major environmental suspect databases of interest in the context of human biomonitoring, demonstrating the current extensive gap between the number of potential substances of interest (up to hundreds of thousands) and measured spectra (0.57–3.6% of the total chemicals have spectral information available). Furthermore, certain datasets are benchmarked, based on previous efforts, to show the extent to which acquired experimental data were comparable between laboratories, even with HRMS instruments based on different technologies (i.e., quadrupole–quadrupole-time of flight versus ion trap/quadrupole-Orbitrap). Instruments and settings that are less comparable are also revealed, primarily linear ion trap instruments, which show distinctly lower comparability.

Conclusions
Based on these efforts, harmonization guidelines for the acquisition and processing of tandem mass spectrometry data are proposed to enable European (and ideally worldwide) laboratories to contribute to common resources, without requiring extensive changes to their current in house methods.",,https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-020-00314-9,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00314-9

Environmental and health concerns prompted the development of chemical safety testing and, in the context of endocrine disruption, identification of thyroid hormone axis disrupting chemicals (THADCs) remains particularly challenging. As various molecules are known to interfere with different levels of TH signalling, screening tests for THADCs may not rely solely on in vitro ligand/receptor binding to TH receptors. Therefore, alternatives to mammalian in vivo assays featuring TH-related endpoints that are more sensitive than circulatory THs and more rapid than thyroid histopathology are needed to fulfil the ambition of higher throughput screening of the myriad of environmental chemicals. After a detailed introduction of the context, we have listed current assays and parameters to assess thyroid disruption following a literature search of recent publications referring to non-mammalian models. Potential THADCs were mostly investigated in zebrafish and the frog Xenopus laevis, an amphibian model extensively used to study TH signalling.","Testing for thyroid hormone (TH) disruptors is particularly challenging due to the lack of validated in vitro assays.

Time course of phthalate cumulative risks to male developmental health over a 27-year period: Biomonitoring samples of the German Environmental Specimen Bank,"Petra Apel, Andreas Kortenkamp, Holger M. Koch, Nina Vogel, Maria Rüther, Monika Kasper-Sonnenberg, Andre Conrad, Thomas Brüning, Marike Kolossa-Gehring",2020-02,Phthalates; Urinary metabolites; Human biomonitoring; Daily intake; Cumulative risk assessment; Hazard Index,"In several human biomonitoring surveys, changes in the usage patterns of phthalates have come to light, but their influence on the risks associated with combined exposures is insufficiently understood. Based on the largest study to date, the 27-year survey of urinary phthalate metabolite levels in 24-hour urine samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank, we present a deep analysis of changing phthalate exposures on mixture risks. This analysis adopts the Hazard Index (HI) approach based on the five phthalates DBP, DIBP, BBP, DEHP and DINP. Calculations of the hazard index for each study participant included updated phthalate reference doses for anti-androgenicity (RfDAAs) that take account of new evidence of phthalates’ developmental toxicity.

The Maximum Cumulative Ratio (MCR) approach was used to establish whether a subject’s combined exposure was dominated by one phthalate or was influenced by several phthalates simultaneously. Generally, over the years there was a shift towards lower HIs and higher MCRs, reflecting an increased complexity of the combined exposures. The decade from 1988 to about 1999 was characterised by rather high HIs of between 3 and 7 (95th percentile) which were driven by exposure to DBP and DEHP, often exceeding their single acceptable exposures. Traditional single phthalate risk assessments would have underestimated these risks by up to 50%. From 2006 onwards, no study participant experienced exposures above acceptable levels for a single phthalate, but combined exposures were still in excess of HI = 1. From 2011 onwards most individuals stayed below HI = 1. In interpreting these results, we caution against the use of HI = 1 as an acceptable limit and develop proposals for improved and more realistic mixture risk assessments that take account of co-exposures to other anti-androgenic substances also capable of disrupting the male reproductive system. From this perspective, we regard HIs between 0.1 and 0.2 as more appropriate for evaluating combined phthalate exposures. Assessed against lowered HIs of 0.1 – 0.2, the combined phthalate exposures of most study participants exceeded acceptable levels in all study years, including 2015. Continued monitoring efforts for phthalate combinations are required to provide the basis for appropriate risk management measures.","Phthalate mixture risk assessment for changing exposure patterns over 27 years.

Comparison of the resulting data show that even with similarly-acting compounds in the same cell line, considerable variation was observed with respect to the numbers and identities of differentially expressed genes. Greater concordance was observed when considering the whole data sets and biological functions associated with the genes affected.

EDCs act at low doses and particularly vulnerable periods of exposure include pre- and perinatal development. Of critical concern is the number of pesticides with the potential to interfere with the developing nervous system and brain, notably with thyroid hormone signaling.

Thus, humans and wildlife are exposed to complex mixtures, never one chemical at a time and rarely with only one dominating effect. Hence there is an urgent need to develop strategies on how exposure to multiple hazardous chemicals and the combination of their effects can be assessed. A workshop, “Advancing the Assessment of Chemical Mixtures and their Risks for Human Health and the Environment” was organized in May 2018 together with Joint Research Center in Ispra, EU-funded research projects and Commission Services and relevant EU agencies. This forum for researchers and policy-makers was created to discuss and identify gaps in risk assessment and governance of chemical mixtures as well as to discuss state of the art science and future research needs. Based on the presentations and discussions at this workshop we want to bring forward the following Key Messages:
•
We are at a turning point: multiple exposures and their combined effects require better management to protect public health and the environment from hazardous chemical mixtures.

•
Regulatory initiatives should be launched to investigate the opportunities for all relevant regulatory frameworks to include prospective mixture risk assessment and consider combined exposures to (real-life) chemical mixtures to humans and wildlife, across sectors.

•
Precautionary approaches and intermediate measures (e.g. Mixture Assessment Factor) can already be applied, although, definitive mixture risk assessments cannot be routinely conducted due to significant knowledge and data gaps.

•
A European strategy needs to be set, through stakeholder engagement, for the governance of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and mixtures. The strategy would include research aimed at scientific advancement in mechanistic understanding and modelling techniques, as well as research to address regulatory and policy needs. Without such a clear strategy, specific objectives and common priorities, research, and policies to address mixtures will likely remain scattered and insufficient.","Multiple exposures and their combined effects require better risk management.

We first extracted from different databases BPF-protein associations that were expanded to protein complexes using protein-protein interaction datasets. Over-representation analysis of the protein complexes allowed to identify the most relevant biological pathways putatively targeted by BPF. Then, automatic screening of scientific abstracts from literature using the text mining tool, AOP-helpFinder, combined with data integration from various sources (AOP-wiki, CompTox, etc.) and manual curation allowed us to link BPF to AOP events. Finally, we combined all the information gathered through those analyses and built a comprehensive complex framework linking BPF to an AOP network including, as adverse outcomes, various types of cancers such as breast and thyroid malignancies.

A review of phthalate pharmacokinetics in human and rat: what factors drive phthalate distribution and partitioning?,"Elena Domínguez-Romero, Martin Scheringer",2019-06,Phthalate; partition coefficient; distribution; pharmacokinetic;algorithm;experiment;binding;hydrophobicity;ionization;metabolism,"Phthalates are a class of compounds that have been extensively used as plasticizers in different applications. Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in the EU, because of their toxicity for reproduction. However, high amounts of other phthalates are still produced and imported in the European Economic Area. In China and the US, recent studies show increasing concentrations of several phthalates in the air and in human urine, respectively. The understanding of phthalate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (‘pharmacokinetics’) in the organism is still limited. Specifically, phthalate partitioning among tissues is insufficiently understood. Here, we estimate partition coefficient (PC) values for different phthalates by using five algorithms and compare them to experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) PC values. In addition, we review all pharmacokinetic steps for phthalates in human and rat, based on data from 133 peer-reviewed publications. We analyze the factors that determine phthalate partitioning and pharmacokinetics. Four processes are particularly relevant to phthalate distribution: protein binding, ionization, passive partitioning, and metabolism in different tissues. The interplay of these processes needs to be better represented in methods for determining the PC values of phthalates. The hydrophobicity of phthalates affects all pharmacokinetic steps. The exposure route has an influence on specific steps of phthalate pharmacokinetics but generally does not affect the pattern of metabolites in urine. The age of the organism has an influence on phthalate metabolism. More studies on the protein-bound fraction of phthalates in plasma and pharmacokinetic studies following inhalation and dermal exposure are desirable.",,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03602532.2019.1620762?scroll=top&needAccess=true,https://doi.org/10.1080/03602532.2019.1620762

Complementing exposure biomarkers with mechanistically based effect biomarkers may further elucidate causal pathways between chemical exposure and adverse health outcomes. We combined information on effect biomarkers previously implemented in human observational studies with mechanisms of action reported in experimental studies and with information from published Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), focusing on adverse reproductive effects of phthalate exposure. Phthalates constitute a group of chemicals that are ubiquitous in consumer products and have been related to a wide range of adverse health effects. As a result of a comprehensive literature search, we present an overview of effect biomarkers for reproductive toxicity that are substantiated by mechanistic information. The activation of several receptors, such as PPARα, PPARγ, and GR, may initiate events leading to impaired male and female fertility as well as other adverse effects of phthalate exposure.

It results from total exposure to chemical substances from different sources and via different routes. These substances may be regulated under different legislative frameworks on chemicals (e.g., environmental, occupational, food safety etc). In occupational health, HBM has long traditions to control the exposures at workplaces. By providing accurate data on internal exposure, HBM data can improve human health risk assessment (RA) for both the general population and workers. Although the past few years have shown good examples on the use of HBM in the RA of chemicals, there is still quite some work to be done to improve its use in a regulatory RA.

Under the scope of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017–2021), the current study reviews the state-of-the-art of HBM use in chemicals RA with a special focus in Europe, and attempts to identify hurdles and challenges faced by regulators. To gather information on the use of HBM, including the availability of guidance on how to use it in RA, the RA schemes applied by different European or international organizations were analysed. Examples of such use were identified for a few selected groups of chemicals of concern for human health. In addition, we present the results of a survey, aimed at collecting information from national regulatory risk assessors on their day-to-day RA practices, the use of HBM data, and the obstacles and challenges related to their use. The results evidenced and explained some of the current obstacles of using HBM data in RA. These included the lack of HBM guidance values or biomonitoring equivalents (BEs), limited toxicokinetic information to support the interpretation of HBM data and, in the occupational health and safety (OSH) field, the lack of legal enforcement. Therefore, to support the integration of HBM in regulatory RA, we recommend, on one hand, the elaboration of a EU level guidance on the use of HBM in RA and, on the other hand, the continuation of research efforts to integrate HBM with new RA approaches using in vitro/in silico data and Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs).","Overview of risk assessment (RA) schemes and their use of HBM data.

Linking Bisphenol S to Adverse Outcome Pathways Using a Combined Text Mining and Systems Biology Approach,"Jean-Charles Carvaillo, Robert Barouki, Xavier Coumoul and Karine Audouze",2019-04,,"Background:
Available toxicity data can be optimally interpreted if they are integrated using computational approaches such as systems biology modeling. Such approaches are particularly warranted in cases where regulatory decisions have to be made rapidly.

Objectives:
The study aims at developing and applying a new integrative computational strategy to identify associations between bisphenol S (BPS), a substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), and components of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).

Methods:
The proposed approach combines a text mining (TM) procedure and integrative systems biology to comprehensively analyze the scientific literature to enrich AOPs related to environmental stressors. First, to identify relevant associations between BPS and different AOP components, a list of abstracts was screened using the developed text-mining tool AOP-helpFinder, which calculates scores based on the graph theory to prioritize the findings. Then, to fill gaps between BPS, biological events, and adverse outcomes (AOs), a systems biology approach was used to integrate information from the AOP-Wiki and ToxCast databases, followed by manual curation of the relevant publications.

Results:
Links between BPS and 48 AOP key events (KEs) were identified and scored via 31 references. The main outcomes were related to reproductive health, endocrine disruption, impairments of metabolism, and obesity. We then explicitly analyzed co-mention of the terms BPS and obesity by data integration and manual curation of the full text of the publications. Several molecular and cellular pathways were identified, which allowed the proposal of a biological explanation for the association between BPS and obesity.

Conclusions:
By analyzing dispersed information from the literature and databases, our novel approach can identify links between stressors and AOP KEs. The findings associating BPS and obesity illustrate the use of computational tools in predictive toxicology and highlight the relevance of the approach to decision makers assessing substituents to toxic chemicals.",,https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP4200?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed,https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4200

Human exposure to and environmental contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was previously reported in a region near a former PCB production facility in Slovakia. However, we found that the indoor residential PCB levels did not correlate with the distance from the facility. Rather, indoor levels in this region and those reported in the literature were related to the historic PCB use on a national scale and the inferred presence of primary sources of PCBs in the homes. Other SVOCs had levels linked with either the activities in the home, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with wood heating; or outdoor activities, e.g., organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with agricultural land use and building age. We propose a classification framework to prioritize SVOCs for monitoring in indoor environments and to evaluate risks from indoor SVOC exposures. Application of this framework to 88 measured SVOCs identified several PCB congeners (CB-11, -28, -52), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), benzo(a)pyrene, and γ-HCH as priority compounds based on high exposure and toxicity assessed by means of toxicity reference values (TRVs). Application of the framework to many emerging compounds such as novel flame retardants was not possible because of either no or outdated TRVs. Concurrent identification of seven SVOC groups in indoor environments provided information on their comparative levels and distributions, their sources, and informed our assessment of associated risks.","Indoor residential PCB levels do not correlate with the distance from PCB factory.

Prioritization of hazards of novel flame retardants using the mechanistic toxicology information from ToxCast and Adverse Outcome Pathways,"Lola Bajard, Lisa Melymuk and Ludek Blaha ",2019-02,Flame retardants; ToxCast; AOP; Prioritization; Hazard; Mechanisms of toxicity,"Background
Flame retardants (FRs) are used in most consumer products and textiles to comply with current flammability standards. After the restriction of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, a large number of chemically diverse replacement FRs are increasingly used, but the risk they represent is not yet properly evaluated and their toxicity pathways are still poorly understood.

Approach
We collected in vivo toxicological information on 62 (including 52 non-regulated) FRs and established five prioritization categories (Cat I to V) based on data availability and toxicological concern. We then considered available in vitro toxicological data from ToxCast, as a complement to in vivo information. By combining these information sources, we then explored relevant toxicity mechanisms for nine selected FRs (Cat I) using the AOP (Adverse Outcome Pathway) framework.

Results
For 20 FRs (Cat V), toxicological data on mammals were absent. Data available were scarce for another 22 FRs, of which 14 FRs (Cat II) may be of toxicological concern. We found substantial information for only ten replacement FRs, of which nine (Cat I) present some toxicological concern: tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tri(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP). ToxCast results confirmed in vivo based categorization for several FRs and identified potential molecular targets. For the nine Cat I FRs, we identified several molecular targets, health outcomes and some potential AOPs. However, the complete toxicity pathways leading from molecular targets to adverse health outcomes are still unknown, with the exception of TBBPA-induced neurotoxicity.

Conclusions
The approach presented in this study was particularly useful for the categorization of a large group of replacement FRs with relatively low data availability. We highlight priority compounds that critically need more toxicological studies or FRs for which regulatory measures could be envisaged. Our research also suggests that high toxicity indicated by ToxCast is particularly relevant for predicting higher hazard in vivo. Finally, we indicate several gaps and directions for future research, such as molecular targets that could be tested in vitro and health outcomes for cohort studies.",,https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-019-0195-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-019-0195-z
Physiology-based toxicokinetic modeling in the frame of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative,"Sarigiannis, D.A., Karakitsios, S., Dominguez-Romero, E., Papadaki, K., Brochot, C., Kumar, V., Schumacher, M., Sy, M., Mielke, H., Greiner, M., Mengelers, M., Scheringer, M.",2019-01,,"Given the opportunities provided by internal dosimetry modelling in the interpretation of human biomonitoring (HBM) data, the assessment of the links between exposure to chemicals and observed HBM data can be effectively supported by PBTK modelling. This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues.

Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals.

Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds.

The optimal range of collision energies for spectral comparison was evaluated using 233 overlapping compounds between the two libraries, revealing that spectra in the range of CE 20–50 eV on the QqTOF and 30–60 nominal collision energy units on the Orbitrap provided optimal matching results for these libraries. Applications to complex samples from the respective institutes revealed that the libraries, combined with a simple data mining approach to retrieve all spectra with precursor and fragment information, could confirm many validated target identifications and yield several new Level 2a (spectral match) identifications.

From this angle, policy questions like whether an implemented policy to reduce chemical exposure has had an effect over time, whether the health of people in specific regions or subpopulations is at risk, or whether the body burden of chemical substances (the internal exposure) varies with, for example, time, country, sex, age, or socio-economic status, need to be answered. Indicators can help to synthesize complex scientific information into a few key descriptors with the purpose of providing an answer to a non-expert audience. Human biomonitoring (HBM) indicators at the European Union (EU) level are unfortunately lacking. Within the Horizon2020 European Human Biomonitoring project HBM4EU, an approach to develop European HBM indicators was worked out. To learn from and ensure interoperability with other European indicators, 15 experts from the HBM4EU project (German Umweltbundesamt (UBA), Flemish research institute VITO, University of Antwerp, European Environment Agency (EEA)), and the World Health Organization (WHO), European Core Health Indicator initiative (ECHI), Eurostat, Swiss ETH Zurich and the Czech environmental institute CENIA, and contributed to a workshop, held in June 2017 at the EEA in Copenhagen. First, selection criteria were defined to evaluate when and if results of internal chemical exposure measured by HBM, need to be translated into a European HBM-based indicator. Two main aspects are the HBM indicator’s relevance for policy, society, health, and the quality of the biomarker data (availability, comparability, ease of interpretation). Secondly, an approach for the calculation of the indicators was designed. Two types of indicators were proposed: ‘sum indicators of internal exposure’ derived directly from HBM biomarker concentrations and ‘indicators for health risk’, comparing HBM concentrations to HBM health-based guidance values (HBM HBGVs). In the latter case, both the percentage of the studied population exceeding the HBM HBGVs (PE) and the extent of exceedance (EE), calculated as the population’s exposure level divided by the HBM HBGV, can be calculated. These indicators were applied to two examples of hazardous chemicals: bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which both have high policy and societal relevance and for which high quality published data were available (DEMOCOPHES, Swedish monitoring campaign). European HBM indicators help to summarize internal exposure to chemical substances among the European population and communicate to what degree environmental policies are successful in keeping internal exposures sufficiently low. The main aim of HBM indicators is to allow follow-up of chemical safety in Europe.",,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/10/2085,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15102085

This raises concerns about their impact on public and environmental health. The risk assessment of chemicals for regulatory purposes mainly relies on the assessment of individual chemicals. If exposure to multiple chemicals is considered in a legislative framework, it is usually limited to chemicals falling within this framework and co-exposure to chemicals that are covered by a different regulatory framework is often neglected. Methodologies and guidance for assessing risks from combined exposure to multiple chemicals have been developed for different regulatory sectors, however, a harmonised, consistent approach for performing mixture risk assessments and management across different regulatory sectors is lacking. At the time of this publication, several EU research projects are running, funded by the current European Research and Innovation Programme Horizon 2020 or the Seventh Framework Programme. They aim at addressing knowledge gaps and developing methodologies to better assess chemical mixtures, by generating and making available internal and external exposure data, developing models for exposure assessment, developing tools for in silico and in vitro effect assessment to be applied in a tiered framework and for grouping of chemicals, as well as developing joint epidemiological-toxicological approaches for mixture risk assessment and for prioritising mixtures of concern.
